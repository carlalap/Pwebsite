# Personal WebSite

<p>Much like your LinkedIn profile, your personal website demonstrates what makes you searchable online and how you portray yourself as a professional. Your personal website is the place in your portfolio materials where you have the most creative liberty to showcase who you are and what you’ve created. By the end of this project you’ll have a personal website you can link to your resume and LinkedIn profile.
</p>

<p>For creating your website, you can use whatever tools you want - and use an existing template.  For the purpose of the project, I will use React JS and Tailwind CSS.
